# self-introduction.jsp
self.title1_1 = My values
self.co1_1 = \u201CA talent who practices love for colleagues\u201D
self.co1_2 = I have a slightly different social experience.
self.co1_3 = Starting as an intern in 2015, I served as a crew member on a ship for many years.  Because I worked in an extreme working environment where I could not let go of tension even for a moment, 24 hours a day, I am prepared to adapt anywhere with a stronger mentality than anyone else.
self.co1_4 = Also, I am a person with extraordinary passion.
self.co1_5 = When living abroad, because of the language barrier and differences in appearances, sailors return to their respective rooms after each work is completed without a single proper conversation.  However, I wanted to create a humane work environment where co-workers at one company trust, respect and live in harmony with each other. We also wanted to achieve everyone's goal of safe navigation more efficiently. So I acted.

self.co1_6 = First, I approached my foreign colleagues who worked in the same department, talked to them, had meals with them, and did many things together. As we spent more time together, my poor English skills were revealed. However, rather than being ashamed of this, I participated more actively in the conversation and tried to communicate by opening an electronic dictionary during the conversation. These proactive actions brought about small changes in the minds of my colleagues, and as time went by, I was able to work with my colleagues while laughing, and further support each other.
self.co1_7 = Through this experience, I learned the act of listening to those around you, the impact it can have, and how happy it makes you to have someone who listens to you.  I value relationships between people and prefer to increase work efficiency through cooperation among colleagues. Even after joining the company, I will continue to love my colleagues just as I did before.

self.title2_1 = pros and cons of personality
self.co2_1 = \u201CA talent who is not afraid of change\u201D
self.co2_2 = My strengths were that I listened to and responded well to the opinions of my friends and people around me during my school days, and maintained good interpersonal relationships.
self.co2_3 = On the downside, I had an embarrassing experience not being able to say no due to my introverted personality. In order to change this personality, I participated in a magic club while attending school and performed magic performances in parks and on the streets, changing my personality to become more extroverted. Through this effort, I changed my personality and gained confidence that I could accomplish anything, and I was able to persevere in my efforts when difficult tasks arose.

self.title3_1 = Describe the attitude and capabilities that the person in charge of the job you are applying for must have.
self.co3_1 = I think it is important to adapt well to the job no matter what job you do.
self.co3_2 = I work on a high-intensity ship, and once I get on board, I live on the sea 24 hours a day, 3 shifts for as short as 6 months and as long as a year, without weekends and holidays, Whenever I get on board, I meet new people, handle new equipment, and I am confident that I will adapt well to any work. In addition, touching various equipment has led to many accidents and emergencies, and as we have solved them, we are now able to calmly analyze and deal with any problems.

self.title4_1 = Aspirations after I entered
self.co4_1 = I think joining the company is just the beginning. I will help your company with two goals.
self.co4_2 = First, I will run without stopping.
self.co4_3 = You will continue your education to become a professional developer. We will contribute to your company's development by not being complacent and evolving.
self.co4_4 = Second, I will always be an employee who works with a sense of duty.
self.co4_5 = I believe that development is a job that contributes to the completeness of a product and affects its reliability. Therefore, minor differences will become indicators of a complete result. If I become a developer, I will always have a sense of mission and contribute to becoming a trustworthy company with accurate results.
